Compose test sample

This project has been **ARCHIEVED**. I think this project got outdated. So it's probably an abandonware. It's here for history only.

This project helped me understand how to add screenshot testing on Android using Jetpack Compose and [pedrovgs/Shot](https://github.com/pedrovgs/Shot) library

After this I'd applied this concept on two commercial apps to garantee quality on Design System components.
